If you have a page consisting of images that are all links to full
size versions, you might want some kind of lightbox view.  Perhaps it
looks like:

    <script src="lightbox.js">
    <a href="..."><img src="..."></a>
    <a href="..."><img src="..."></a>
    <a href="..."><img src="..."></a>
    <a href="..."><img src="..."></a>

This script will add "onclick" handlers for each of the images so if
you click on them they go full screen on a black background, and the
left and right arrow keys will move between sequential images.
